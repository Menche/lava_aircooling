lava_aircool
============

Makes flowing lava cool by itself if too far from a source
Lava that is contained will *usually* not cool. The mod checks for containment only by counting the number of solid nodes around it, so it isn't perfect. To prevent accidental spills, I tried to err on the side of too much cooling.
